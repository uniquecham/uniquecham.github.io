### Self Assessment

As my tenure at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) is ending, it has been bittersweet. The last couple of years have been rewarding and yet challenging at times. I have been a student at SNHU since 2019, working on my BS in Computer Science. Some challenges that I have faced were many sleepless nights and anxiety. There were many times that I wanted to give up because the classes were highly demanding &amp; rigorous. After attending tutoring sessions and working with the professors, eventually, I was eventually able to grasp computer science concepts. It's been rewarding because when I first started, I was lost and did not understand the idea of computer science. It was like learning a foreign language; however, I accomplished some things that I thought were impossible, and I overcame a lot of anxieties and fears. I developed coding skills using different languages, such as Python, Java, C++, and MongoDB. Now, armed with proficiency in these languages and databases, I have translated complex algorithms into tangible visual objects and data-driven solutions.

The process of creating this ePortfolio and navigating through the coursework has been a transformative journey, preparing me for the dynamic field of computer science. I've honed my technical skills, delving into programming intricacies and algorithmic complexities. This journey has also provided me with invaluable insights into the importance of teamwork and effective communication. But more importantly, it has instilled in me a deep sense of ethical responsibility. I've come to understand that technological advancements are not just about coding and algorithms; they have far-reaching societal implications. I am eager to apply these newfound skills and insights as I embark on a career in this ever-evolving field, always mindful of ethical considerations.

My work with data structures and algorithms is one of the most notable examples of my growth. Initially, these concepts seemed daunting, but they became more manageable through dedicated study and practical application. For instance, in my enhanced artifact for the 3D pyramid project, I applied efficient data structures like structs for mesh representation and arrays or maps for color management. These streamlined the organization of geometric data and color assignment. I also used algorithms such as perspective projection and matrix multiplication to enable accurate rendering and rotation of the pyramid. Balancing efficiency and readability, I ensured optimal performance and maintainability in the codebase.

This program has equipped me with technical prowess and soft skills crucial for success in the workplace. Collaborating in team environments, I've learned the art of compromise and the strength that diverse perspectives bring to a project. One standout instance was our group project to develop a software application. Through effective delegation and clear communication, we transformed a concept into a fully functional product, highlighting the power of teamwork in achieving a common goal.

When using MongoDB Compass for querying, a security mindset is crucial. This involves implementing authentication and authorization to control access, encrypting data in transit and at rest, and validating user inputs to prevent injection attacks. Additionally, optimizing queries and regularly monitoring database activity help detect and mitigate potential security risks, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the database.

This ePortfolio is a curated collection of my growth, skills, and aspirations. Each artifact contributes to a comprehensive view of my capabilities, from coding proficiency to teamwork and ethical considerations. As you navigate the artifacts, you'll find a cohesive narrative of a dedicated learner evolving into a well-rounded computer science professional.

As I prepare to enter the workforce, I am confident in my abilities to meet the technical demands of the field, collaborate effectively, communicate clearly, and uphold the highest ethical standards. This ePortfolio is a culmination of my academic achievements and a preview of the value and dedication I bring to any team or project.

### Code Review

[Code Review Artifact One](https://youtu.be/aW5Z4jFfNMo "Brick Game Code Review Video")<br/>

I perform a code review for artifact one (Software Enginerring & Design). In this code review, I analyzed the original code for vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. This code review are a walk-through of existing code and planned enhancements, and it demonstrates the following critical elements for each category:

* Existing functionality: A detailed walk-through of the existing code focused on the features and function of the current code.
* Code Analysis: Adding a Paddle to the brick game gives the user an option to use besides just the ball shooting from everywhere to destroy the bricks. Adding lives keeps track of the lives remaining instead of just hitting the escape key to finish the game. 
* Enhancements: Step by step of planned enhancements to improve the user experience and gameplay of the brick game.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement Narrative

[Software Design and Engineering Narrative](ArtifactOne3-2MilestoneTwoCS499SoftwareandDesign.pdf)


Artifact One was an enhancement on a basic brick game created in CS-330, where I added a paddled and 3 lives. When the ball went under the paddle three times the game was over. If the ball hit the paddle the the debug error appeared and you will have to hit escape on the keyboard to exit out the game.

Artifact 2_CS 499 4-2 Milestone Three_ Enhancement Two_ Algorithms and Data Structure
This is a demostration how I enhanced the origial artifact which was a solid red 3D stationary pyrmid and made it rotate and show different colors on each side using OpenGl and C++.

### Databases Enhancement

[MongoDB Database Milestone](MongoDBDatabaseMilestoneCS499UniqueChambers.pdf)

This artifact demonstrated my skills and abilities to display how to use  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in MongoDB Compass. It will display how a record was created in the database "AAC", in the "animal" collection. The record was for a male dog name "Ace" that was black and white. The record was querried and located. It was updated to change his birthday, the the record was deleted.
